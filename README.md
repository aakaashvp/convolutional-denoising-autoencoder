# Convolutional Autoencoder for Image Denoising

## AIM

To develop a convolutional autoencoder for image denoising application.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

## Convolution Autoencoder Network Model

Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Download and split the dataset into training and testing datasets
### STEP 2:
rescale the data as that the training is made easy
### STEP 3:
create the model for the program , in this experiment we create to networks , one for encoding and one for decoding 
Write your own steps

## PROGRAM

Include your code here
